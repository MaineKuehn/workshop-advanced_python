# Holistic Python Programming 

* Python is *not* slow
    * Highly efficient data structures
    * Optimised builtin algorithms
    * Implemented as raw C/Java/C#/Magic
* Python has to do *a lot*
    * Unwrap namespaces
    * Pack/unpack function input/output
    * No undefined behaviour allowed
    * All side-effects must be honored

--

## Be like Water

* Nothing is faster than not doing anything
* Efficient Python code is designed, not compiled
* Pick algorithms suitable for your problem
    * O(n) beats O(n^2) eventually

--

## Shared Secret

* Just pick an appropriate data structure
* Python probably has them...
    * ...or a custom library does
